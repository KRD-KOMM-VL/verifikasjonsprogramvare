/**
 * @namespace cppVerifier::arithm 
 * 
 * @brief Implements useful algebraic structures such as groups,
 * fields, p-subgroups, etc.
 *
 * The simplest classes in this module are Elmt and
 * CollectionOfElmts. These are used to store and read arbitrarily
 * large integers from bytetrees (class LargeNumber), elements of
 * product groups (class ProdGrpElmt) and collections of such elements
 * (CollectionOfElmts).
 *
 * Then, there are algebraic structures; namely (multiplicative)
 * Group, Field...). These provide operations as they are performed in
 * these mathematical objects over Elmt's.
 *
 * An Elmt is essentially a tree with large numbers as its
 * leaves. Large integers are provided by mpz_class instances from the
 * <a
 * href="http://gmplib.org/manual/C_002b_002b-Interface-Integers.html">gmp
 * library</a>).
 *
 * If an element is an element of a product group (i.e. a
 * ProdGrpElmt), then operations are performed componentwise.
