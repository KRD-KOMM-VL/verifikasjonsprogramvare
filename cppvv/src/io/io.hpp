/**
 * @namespace cppVerifier::io 
 * 
 * @brief Implements basic input and output operations for a verifier.
 *
 * Input is mainly an xml file so functions to parse it are provided
 * by the XmlReader class.
 *
 * The class Arguments makes sense of this configuration file and
 * provides a simple interface to access the variables it defined.
 *
 * Logs can be kept during execution; they are dealt with by the Log
 * class.
